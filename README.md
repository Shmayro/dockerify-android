**Dockerify Android** is a Dockerized Android emulator supporting multiple CPU architectures (**x86** and **arm64** in the near future ...) with native performance and seamless ADB access. It allows developers to run Android virtual devices (AVDs) efficiently within Docker containers, facilitating scalable testing and development environments.

### üî• **Key Feature: Web Interface Access**

Access and control the Android emulator directly in your web browser with the integrated scrcpy-web interface! No additional software needed - just open your browser and start using Android.

> **Benefits of Web Interface:**
> - No extra software to install
> - Access from any computer with a web browser
> - Full touchscreen and keyboard support
> - Perfect for remote work or sharing the emulator with team members

## üîß **Features**

- **Web Interface:** Access the emulator directly from your browser with the integrated scrcpy-web interface.
- **Root and Magisk Preinstalled:** Comes with root access and Magisk preinstalled for advanced modifications.
- **PICO GAPPS Preinstalled:** Includes PICO GAPPS for essential Google services.
- **Seamless ADB Access:** Connect to the emulator via ADB from the host and other networked devices.
- **scrcpy Support:** Mirror the emulator screen using scrcpy for a seamless user experience.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilizes native CPU capabilities for efficient emulation.
- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Runs natively on both **x86** and **arm64** CPU architectures.
- **Docker Integration:** Easily deploy the Android emulator within a Docker container.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple Docker commands to build and run the emulator.
- **Supervisor Management:** Manages emulator processes with Supervisor for reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Docker:** Installed on your system. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose:** For managing multi-container setups. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **KVM Support:** Ensure your system supports KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for hardware acceleration.
  - **Check KVM Support:**

    ```bash
    egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
    ```

    A non-zero output indicates KVM support.

## üöÄ **Installation**

To simplify the setup process, you can use the provided [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Shmayro/dockerify-android/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shmayro/dockerify-android.git
    cd dockerify-android
    ```

2. **Run Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    > **Note:** This command launches the Android emulator and web interface. First boot takes some time to initialize. Once ready, the device will appear in the web interface at http://localhost:8000.

## üì° **Usage**

### Use the Web Interface to Access the Emulator

The **quickest and easiest way** to interact with the Android emulator is through your web browser:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
2. You should see the device listed as "dockerify-android:5555" automatically connected
3. Select one of the available streaming options:
   - **H264 Converter** (recommended for best high-quality experience)
   - Tiny H264 (good for low-bandwidth connections)
   - Broadway.js (fallback option)

> **Note:** First boot may take some time as the Android emulator needs to fully initialize. When everything is ready, the device will appear in the web interface as shown in the screenshot above.

### Connect via ADB

If you need direct ADB access to the emulator:

```bash
adb connect localhost:5555
adb devices
```

**Expected Output:**

```
connected to localhost:5555
List of devices attached
localhost:5555	device
```

### Use scrcpy to Mirror the Emulator Screen

For a native desktop experience, you can use scrcpy:

```bash
scrcpy -s localhost:5555
```

> **Note:** Ensure `scrcpy` is installed on your host machine. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#installation)

## üöß **Roadmap**

- [ ] Support for additional Android versions
- [x] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Support ARM64 CPU architecture
- [x] Preinstall PICO GAPPS
- [x] Support Magisk
- [x] Adding web interface of scrcpy

## üêû **Troubleshooting**

- **ADB Connection Refused:**
  - **Ensure ADB Server is Running:**
    ```bash
    adb start-server -a
    ```
  - **Verify Firewall Settings:** Ensure that port `5555` is open on your server.
  - **Check Emulator Status:** Ensure the emulator has fully booted by checking logs.

    ```bash
    docker logs dockerify-android
    ```

- **Emulator Not Starting:**
  - **Check Supervisor Logs:**

    ```bash
    docker exec -it dockerify-android bash
    cat /var/log/supervisor/emulator.out.log
    cat /var/log/supervisor/emulator.err.log
    ```

- **KVM Not Accessible:**
  - **Verify KVM Installation:**

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep kvm
    ```
  - **Check Permissions:** Ensure your user has access to `/dev/kvm`.
