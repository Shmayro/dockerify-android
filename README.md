**Dockerify Android** is a Dockerized Android emulator supporting multiple CPU architectures (**x86** and **arm64** in the near future ...) with native performance and seamless ADB & Web access. It allows developers to run Android virtual devices (AVDs) efficiently within Docker containers, facilitating scalable testing and development environments.

### üî• **Key Feature: Web Interface Access** üåê

Access and control the Android emulator directly in your web browser with the integrated [scrcpy-web](https://github.com/Shmayro/ws-scrcpy-docker) interface! No additional software needed - just open your browser and start using Android.

> **Benefits of Web Interface:**
> - No extra software to install
> - Access from any computer with a web browser
> - Full touchscreen and keyboard support
> - Perfect for remote work or sharing the emulator with team members

## üîß **Features**

- **üåê Web Interface:** Access the emulator directly from your browser with the integrated [scrcpy-web](https://github.com/Shmayro/ws-scrcpy-docker) interface.
- **Root and Magisk Preinstalled:** Comes with root access and Magisk preinstalled for advanced modifications.
- **PICO GAPPS Preinstalled:** Includes PICO GAPPS for essential Google services.
- **Seamless ADB Access:** Connect to the emulator via ADB from the host and other networked devices.
- **scrcpy Support:** Mirror the emulator screen using scrcpy for a seamless user experience.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilizes native CPU capabilities for efficient emulation.
- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Runs natively on both **x86** and **arm64** CPU architectures.
- **Docker Integration:** Easily deploy the Android emulator within a Docker container.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple Docker commands to build and run the emulator.
- **Supervisor Management:** Manages emulator processes with Supervisor for reliability.
- **Unified Container Logs:** All emulator and boot logs are redirected to Docker's standard log system.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Docker:** Installed on your system. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose:** For managing multi-container setups. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **KVM Support:** Ensure your system supports KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for hardware acceleration.
  - **Check KVM Support:**

    ```bash
    egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
    ```

    A non-zero output indicates KVM support.

## üöÄ **Installation**

To simplify the setup process, you can use the provided [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Shmayro/dockerify-android/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shmayro/dockerify-android.git
    cd dockerify-android
    ```

2. **Run Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    > **Note:** This command launches the Android emulator and web interface. First boot takes some time to initialize. Once ready, the device will appear in the web interface at http://localhost:8000.

## üì° **Usage**

### üåê Use the Web Interface to Access the Emulator

The **quickest and easiest way** to interact with the Android emulator is through your web browser:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
2. You should see the device listed as "dockerify-android:5555" automatically connected
3. Select one of the available streaming options:
   - **H264 Converter** (recommended for best overall experience)
   - Tiny H264 (good for low-bandwidth connections)
   - Broadway.js (fallback option)

> **Note:** First boot may take some time as the Android emulator needs to fully initialize. When everything is ready, the device will appear in the web interface as shown in the screenshot above.

### Connect via ADB

If you need direct ADB access to the emulator:

```bash
adb connect localhost:5555
adb devices
```

**Expected Output:**

```
connected to localhost:5555
List of devices attached
localhost:5555	device
```

### Use scrcpy to Mirror the Emulator Screen

For a native desktop experience, you can use scrcpy:

```bash
scrcpy -s localhost:5555
```

> **Note:** Ensure `scrcpy` is installed on your host machine. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#installation)

## üîÑ **First Boot Process**

The first time you start the container, it will perform a comprehensive setup process that includes:

1. **AVD Creation:** Creates a new Android Virtual Device running Android 30 (Android 11)
2. **Installing PICO GAPPS:** Adds essential Google services to the emulator
3. **Rooting the Device:** Performs multiple reboots to:
   - Disable AVB verification
   - Remount system as writable
   - Install root access via the rootAVD script
   - Install PICO GAPPS components
   - Configure optimal device settings

> **Important:** The first boot can take 10-15 minutes to complete. You'll know the process is finished when you see the following log output:
> ```
> Broadcast completed: result=0
> Sucess !!
> 2025-04-22 13:45:18,724 INFO exited: first-boot (exit status 0; expected)
> ```

> **Note:** If the Android emulator has restarted for any reason, it's recommended to restart the Docker container to reapply optimizations:
> ```bash
> docker compose restart
> ```
> This ensures the following optimizations are applied:
> - Disabled animations for better performance
> - Screen timeout set to 15 seconds
> - Disabled rotation
> - Custom DNS settings
> - Airplane mode enabled (with WiFi still active)
> - Data connection disabled

After the first boot completes, a file marker is created to prevent running the initialization again on subsequent starts.

## üìã **Container Logs**

All logs from the emulator and boot processes are redirected to Docker's standard log system. To view all container logs:

```bash
docker logs dockerify-android
```

This includes:
- Supervisor logs
- Android emulator stdout/stderr
- First-boot process logs

## üöß **Roadmap**

- [ ] Support for additional Android versions
- [x] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Support ARM64 CPU architecture
- [x] Preinstall PICO GAPPS
- [x] Support Magisk
- [x] Adding web interface of [scrcpy](https://github.com/Shmayro/ws-scrcpy-docker)
- [x] Redirect all logs to container stdout/stderr

## üêû **Troubleshooting**

- **ADB Connection Refused:**
  - **Ensure ADB Server is Running:**
    ```bash
    adb start-server -a
    ```
  - **Verify Firewall Settings:** Ensure that port `5555` is open on your server.
  - **Check Emulator Status:** Ensure the emulator has fully booted by checking logs.

    ```bash
    docker logs dockerify-android
    ```

- **First Boot Taking Too Long:**
  - This is normal, as the first boot process needs to perform several operations including:
    - Installing GAPPS
    - Rooting the device
    - Configuring system settings
  - The process can take 10-15 minutes depending on your system performance
  - You can monitor progress with `docker logs -f dockerify-android`

- **Emulator Not Starting:**
  - **Check Container Logs:**

    ```bash
    docker logs dockerify-android
    ```

- **KVM Not Accessible:**
  - **Verify KVM Installation:**

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep kvm
    ```
  - **Check Permissions:** Ensure your user has access to `/dev/kvm`.
